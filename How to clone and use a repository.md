How to clone and use a repository



\* Find the URL of the repository you wish to clone

\* Go to the folder where you want to want it to live

\* type "git clone <url>"

\* you will now see the directory structure of the repository has been created and it contains all the current files.  It is in a folder that has the same name as the repository

\* Go to this folder.

\* You can make changes here, by adding new files and editing existing ones

\* when you have finished changing things you can commit your changes to the repository in VS code or using the appropriate command line commands (git add, git commit)

\* When there are changes or additions to the original repository you can add them by using git pull (make sure you are in the correct directory before doing this)

\* VSCode may need you to merge before the new files/changes appear in your local repository
